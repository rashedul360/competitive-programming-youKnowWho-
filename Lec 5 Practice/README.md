# lecture 5 practice problems

problem 1: Number sum pattern

```
1=1
1+2=3
1+2+3=6
1+2+3+4=10
1+2+3+4+5=15
```

problem 2: square pattern
take an integer n as a input and print square pattern, example:

```
*****
*   *
*   *
*   *
*****
```

#problem 3: pyramid Pattern
take an integer n as input and print pyramid pattern. for example n = 4, the output should be

```
   *
  ***
 *****
*******
```

#problem 4: Half Diamond pattern

take an integer n as a input and print the half diamond pattern. for example

```
   *
  ***
 *****
*******
 *****
  ***
   *
```

# problem 5: Max in an array

take an integer n as a input and then take n integer as a input in an array named a. now print the maximum number in the array
constrains 1<=n<=10 and elements a are at least -10 and most 10
so, for example if n = 4 and the array is [3,1,5,2], then output should be 5

# problem 6: Zero pair sum

take an integer n; input n times to an array;
check i+j = 0;
if zero print like this [0] + [7] = -9 + 9 = 0
range 1<=n<=10; and value rage: least -10 and most 10;

```
when n = 5; [3,1,-3,-3-1];
output:
a[0] + a[2] = 3 + -3 = 0
a[0] + a[3] = 3 + -3 = 0
a[1] + a[4] = 1 + -1 = 0
when n = 10; [-9 ,-2 ,-2, 0, 2, -2, -2, 9, 7, -7];
output:
a[0] + a[7] = -9 + 9 = 0
a[1] + a[4] = -2 + 2 = 0
a[2] + a[4] = -2 + 2 = 0
a[4] + a[5] = 2 + -2 = 0
a[4] + a[6] = 2 + -2 = 0
a[8] + a[9] = 7 + -7 = 0
```

# problem 7: Delete from a string

take string s of lowercase character as a input. now delete first character and print it.
string size: 1<=s<=10;

```
example: hello
output : ello
```
